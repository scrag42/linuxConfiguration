# My Linux Configuration Scripts
This is a work in progress. These are scripts to speed up setting up fresh installs of linux distros. Things such as the network volume mounting are specific to my setup and will need to be updated to meet your needs.

My bash customization is based on mybash from Chris Titus https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech
